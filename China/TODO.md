## Git

I updated .gitignore. I have the following requirements:

- Remove the ignored files from all git commits. When any preivous commit is selected, the ignored file should not be able to be find.
- When merge or rebase to branch main, it should be exact same -- no ignored file in all git commits.
- GitHub should not contain ignored files also, including all git commits.
