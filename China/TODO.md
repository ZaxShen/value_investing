### Progress Bar

Use `rich.progress` to finish following features:

- Enable progress bar for low-level tasks such as bach processing from asyncio (scripts `industry_filter.py`, `sotck_filter.py`)
  - When those tasks finished, make the progress bar disappear
  - Don't make the progress bar disappear for the top level tasks (currenty 3)
